      "summary": "At Squarepoint Capital, I work as a Quantitative Researcher on the Systematic Volatility team, developing short-horizon risk forecasts and alpha signals for SPXW 0DTE options. My research focuses on predicting open-to-close realized volatility by extracting and modeling intraday features such as futures order flow, auction pressure, and order book imbalance. I build execution-aware signal pipelines and scalable multi-asset backtests that account for signal decay, transaction costs, and cross-sectional performance. To support live trading, I automate theoretical IV and delta computations, manage real-time data ingestion, and maintain model inference pipelines in Python and C++, with performance-critical components implemented in multi-threaded C++ using custom data structures. My work is closely integrated with portfolio managers and execution teams to ensure research outputs translate directly into capital allocation, position sizing, and execution logic under systematic risk constraints.",
