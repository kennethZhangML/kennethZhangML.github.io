I conduct trade execution research by building a logistic regression-based fill probability models for equity options, optimizing limit order placement, spread crossing decisions, and execution algorithms to enhance fill rates and minimize slippage using historical market data. I build equity research pipelines in Python with Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to analyze pricing, factor exposures, and earnings data for alpha generation. I perform single-stock research by analyzing earnings revisions, fundamental ratios, and sentiment indicators to identify mispricings and inform systematic trading strategies. Additionally, I engineer alpha factors for single stocks by leveraging alternative data, analyst sentiment, and price-volume relationships, integrating signals into multi-factor equity models.","highlights":["0DTE SPXW Options Trading","Intraday Volatility Estimators","Statistical Arbitrage","Machine Learning","Time Series Modeling","Logistic Regression for Execution","Equity Research Pipelines","Factor Exposure Analysis","Sentiment and Fundamental Indicators","Multi-Factor Equity Models"]},{"name":"Rothschild & Co., RMM Actions USA","position":"Quantitative Engineer","url":"https://am.eu.rothschildandco.com/en/our-funds/rmm-actions-usa/","startDate":"2024-05-01","endDate":"2024-08-30","summary":"I focused on developing statistical arbitrage strategies using advanced time series modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms.
