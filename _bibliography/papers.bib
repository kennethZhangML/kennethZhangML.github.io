  abstract = "State-level policy interventions have been critical in managing
              the spread of the new coronavirus. Here, we study the lag time
              between policy interventions and change in COVID-19 outcome
              trajectory in the United States. We develop a stepwise drifts
              random walk model to account for non-stationarity and strong
              temporal correlation and subsequently apply a change-point
              detection algorithm to estimate the number and times of change
              points in the COVID-19 outcome data. Furthermore, we harmonize
              data on the estimated change points with non-pharmaceutical
              interventions adopted by each state of the United States, which
              provides us insights regarding the lag time between the enactment
              of a policy and its effect on COVID-19 outcomes. We present the
              estimated change points for each state and the District of
              Columbia and find five different emerging trajectory patterns. We
              also provide insight into the lag time between the enactment of a
              policy and its effect on COVID-19 outcomes.",

              regulation suspension with industrial economic viability and
              local air quality in California, United States",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: This study seeks to answer two questions about the
              impacts of the 2020 Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement
              regulation rollbacks: is this suspension bolstering the economic
              viability of industries as oil and manufacturing executives claim
              they will and are these regulations upholding the agency's
              mission of protecting the environment? RESULTS: To answer the
              former question, we utilized 6 months of state employment level
              data from California, United States, as a method of gauging the
              economic health of agency-regulated industries. We implemented a
              machine learning model to predict weekly employment data and a
              t-test to indicate any significant changes in employment. We
              found that, following California's state-issued stay-at-home
              order and the agency's regulation suspension, oil and certain
              manufacturing industries had statistically significant lower
              employment values.To answer the latter question, we used 10 years
              of PM(2.5) levels in California, United States, as a metric for
              local air quality and treatment-control county pairs to isolate
              the impact of regulation rollbacks from the impacts of the state
              lockdown. Using the agency's data, we performed a t-test to
              determine whether treatment-control county pairs experienced a
              significant change in PM(2.5) levels. Even with the statewide
              lockdown-a measure we hypothesized would correlate with decreased
              mobility and pollution levels-in place, counties with oil
              refineries experienced the same air pollution levels when
              compared to historical data averaged from the years 2009 to 2019.
              CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the expectation that the suspension
              would improve the financial health of the oil and manufacturing
              industry, we can conclude that these industries are not
              witnessing economic growth with the suspension and state shutdown
              in place. Additionally, counties with oil refineries could be
              taking advantage of these rollbacks to continue emitting the same
              amount of PM(2.5), in spite of state lockdowns. For these
              reasons, we ask international policymakers to reconsider the
              suspension of enforcement regulations as these actions do not
              fulfill their initial expectations. We recommend the creation and
              maintenance of pollution control and prevention programs that
              develop emission baselines, mandate the construction of pollution
              databases, and update records of pollution emissions.

              evaluated the influences of these pollutants, both individually
              and collaboratively, across various geographic areas and exposure
              windows. We further reviewed the proposed biological mechanisms
              underlying the association between air pollution and COVID-19.

              regarding the implications of COVID-19 and air pollution.",
